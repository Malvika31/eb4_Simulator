#### 3. Instructional Strategy
###### Name of Instructional Strategy  :    <u> Expository
###### Assessment Method: Formative

<u> <b>Description: </b> of how you are going to implement the above Instructional Strategy in your Simulator: </u>
<br>
First of all, we have to start the setup that is the oxyacetylene cylinder so that the flame start at particular pressure after this we move the welding rod and filling rod to required position using button. At last, we do the welding by clicking on the start welding button.

We are using buttons and an instruction panel on the upper window of the simulator so that the user will learn how to use different  equipment  in the experiment.

#### 4. Task & Assessment Questions:

Read the theory and comprehend the concepts related to the experiment. [LO1, LO2, LO3]
<br>

Sr. No |	Learning Objective	| Task to be performed by <br> the student  in the simulator | Assessment Questions as per LO & Task
:--|:--|:--|:-:
1.| Student will able to describe the mixture of gases <br><br> | Click on set cylinder button to know the pressure of oxygen and acetylene gas cylinder  <br><br>  |What is the pressure used in oxygen and acetylene cylinder(in psi) for welding mild steel ?<br><i>A. 11-25/5-7</i><br>B. 25-30/7-10<br>C. 30-33/10-12<br>D. 5-9/1-5
2.|  Student will able to learn <u>gas welding tools and also identify them | Click on spark lighter or set filling rod to know about tools | What is the use of spark lighter ?<br>C. to start welding<br>B. to start the cylinder<br><i>A. to spark the welding torch</i><br>D. to place the filling rod
3.| Student will able to understand the type of flame used in gas welding| Click on spark lighter to observe the color of flame | Which flame is used for gas welding?<br>A. Carburizing<br><i>B. Neutral</i><br>C. Oxydizing<br>D. None of the above
4.|Student will able to make a joint | Click on start welding button to weld the plates | Welding is a temporary or permanent joint ?<br><i>A. permanent</i><br>B. temporary<br>C. semi-permanent<br>D. none of the above

#### 5. Simulator Interactions:
<br>

Sr.No | What Students will do? |	What Simulator will do?	| Purpose of the task
:--|:--|:--|:--:
1.| Student will click on the "start set up" button <br> | The simulator will start the setup  <br>   | To start all the pieces of equipment.
2.| Next the user will click on "manage set up" <br>  <br>  | All the equipment will be get arranged to its origin position <br>   '  | The user will learn the original positioning of equipment
3.| The user will learn the original positioning of equipment <br> | The simulator will perform welding on the metal sheet <br>   '  | The user will observe the changes that will occur after welding
